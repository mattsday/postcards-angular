This demo showcases [Firebase Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) running inside an [Angular](https://angular.dev/) app that can be deployed onto [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting).

It was originally created for the 2024 London Summit, session [BO1.3 - Kick-start your AI journey with Google Cloud](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/london-summit-24?talk=b01-3)

## Overview

This demo is built in two parts: a webapp and a Genkit development environment. Both use the same code, but have different aspects to demo. The most important thing is that it's the same codebase for both - just different tools to interact suitable for different personas and tasks.

See [the documentation](docs/README.md) for more information on how to deploy this and also for an example demo script.

## Using
